Memoization in React Js

Memoization in React is a technique used to optimize the performance of functional components by caching the results of expensive computations or function calls. It's particularly useful when dealing with computationally intensive or frequently called functions with the same input values, as it helps avoid redundant calculations and improves the overall efficiency of the application.

In React, there are three techniques for memoization: React.memo(), useMemo(), and useCallback()
